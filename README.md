## The challenge

In this challenge, you'll be building out an early access landing page that includes custom form validation.
Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
    - The Email address field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
    - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"


## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Web Design
- SCSS

## What I learned
This project's CSS was very difficult for me, positioning things around. Still have a lot to learn, but it was a great practice.

## Useful resources

2. [HTML & CSS Cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/) - Awesome website to remember some CSS selectors and other cool features!
